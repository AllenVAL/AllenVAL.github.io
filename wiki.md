The **balisong**, also known as the *butterfly knife*, is a folding knife that originated in the **Philippines**.  
It features two handles that rotate around the tang, allowing the blade to be concealed within its handles when closed.  
More than just a tool, the balisong has become a *symbol of skill, precision, and artistry* among knife enthusiasts.

## Section 1: History and Origin
The balisong’s history dates back to the early **20th century**, though similar folding mechanisms appeared in Europe centuries earlier.  
In the Philippines, it became part of local culture and craftsmanship, particularly in the province of **Batangas**, where artisans hand-forged each knife.  
Originally, it was used both as a **utility knife** and a **self-defense weapon**, but today, it’s primarily appreciated for its design and flipping techniques.

## Section 2: Design and Mechanics
A balisong consists of:
- **Blade** – the sharpened or dull edge used for cutting or practice.
- **Handles** – two symmetrical grips that rotate around the tang.
- **Latch** – a small locking piece to secure the handles when closed.

### Subsection 1: Blade Types
Blades can vary in style — from **drop-point** and **tanto** to **trainer blades** with no sharp edge.  
Collectors often prefer handmade blades crafted from **D2 tool steel** or **damascus steel** for durability and aesthetic appeal.

### Subsection 2: Handle Materials
Common materials include **stainless steel**, **titanium**, **G10**, and **carbon fiber**.  
Each material affects the knife’s *balance*, *weight*, and *flipping performance*.

Many flippers share tutorials on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=balisong+tricks) or post short clips on *Instagram* showcasing freestyle flipping routines.  
The sport emphasizes **creativity**, **control**, and **safety**, as trainers (non-sharp balisongs) allow beginners to practice without injury.
